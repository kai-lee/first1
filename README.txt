The Reset CSS page is from Chris Morris's Class that he openly distributed.

The Default CSS is my own work and have been continually using/updating as the need arises.

At times I may be forced to force update github due to my stupidity.

Last github history was using the files directly from my users folder rather than the /var/www/first1 file

Current Total lost updates: 10 (this number will continually accumulate when I discover my stupidity, lets hope it stays this small)

Note to self: FILE LOCATIONS YOU IDIOT
